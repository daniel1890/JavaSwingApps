Small Swing app that contains a formpanel which submits the user's name and occupation on a textpanel. For now I will work without WindowBuilder to organize my code better. The button implements
an actionlistener and the mainframe communicates with these listeners and performs an event if neccessary. The goal is to work towards a full fledged Model View Controller design.
